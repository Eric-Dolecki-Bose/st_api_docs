# st_api_docs
An HTML/JavaScript/CSS static site of SoundTouch API documentation (idea).

I put this together simply as an experiment and a potential goal of how a Bose documentation static site might be configured. Stressing sample code in the right column. 

  - Site was hand-coded based upon a system I found somewhere (this site is two years old, I don't remember the original source to help me).
  - The site is not generated from a script based upon any source material/SDK foundational assets/commenting.
